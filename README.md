For my Master's graduation project in Computer Engineering, I developed an iOS app for live face detection and emotion recognition using Swift. The app accesses the front camera to detect faces and predict emotions. It works asynchronously to update the UI with yellow rectangles for detected faces and emotion labels. I also trained a custom model using CoreML and CreateML, working with a dataset to enable accurate real-time emotion prediction within the app.
